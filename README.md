# Machine Learning Course Repository

## Abstract
The course is dedicated to studying the fundamental methods of machine learning. The topics covered can be divided into three blocks. The first block focuses on data handling and preliminary data analysis. Python libraries for working with tabular data and visualization are studied, along with methods for data preprocessing and preparing categorical and textual data. The second block covers supervised learning, including linear models, decision trees, model ensembles (random forest, gradient boosting and their implementations), and their applications in recommender systems. The third block explores unsupervised learning methods such as clustering, visualization, and dimensionality reduction. All topics are accompanied by hands-on practice on real-world datasets. By the end of the course, participants will be able to formulate machine learning tasks, select quality metrics, train models, tune hyperparameters, and conduct validation.
